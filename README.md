# A* Algorithm Implementation in Python

A* Algorithm Implementation** provides an efficient pathfinding solution for graphs using Python.
This project implements the A* (A-star) algorithm, which is widely used in various applications such as robotics, game development, and navigation systems.
The A* algorithm combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search to find the shortest path efficiently.

## Features

- Python implementation of the A* algorithm for pathfinding.
- Efficiently finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- Supports customizable heuristics to optimize pathfinding for different use cases.
- Demonstrates practical use in grid-based maps and general graph structures.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed:

1. **Python 3.x** â€“ Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

No additional packages are required for the core implementation. However, for visualization or advanced features, you may need libraries like `matplotlib` or `networkx`.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/a-star-algorithm-python.git
